# Release Notes - Timer CLI

## [v0.0.5] - 2026-02-03

🚀 **The High-Performance History Update**

This release brings a complete overhaul to the history system, transforming simple logs into a powerful, searchable, and ultra-responsive audit trail.

### 🚀 New Features
*   **Advanced History Viewer**: A new dual-mode viewer that groups events by unique item ID, providing a hierarchical "Lifecycle View" of your time.
*   **Chronological Audit Trail**: Sorting logic now intelligently groups activities by session (latest first) while keeping internal session events in chronological order. 
*   **Running Totals**: See the exact elapsed time for every event relative to its start (e.g., `(+00:05:20)`) in the grouped view.
*   **Lap Numbering**: Stopwatches now automatically track and display lap counts (Lap 1, Lap 2, etc.) within the history view.

### ⚡ Improvements
*   **Optimized Caching Engine**: History views are now pre-calculated and cached, ensuring instantaneous scrolling and mode-switching even with thousands of log entries.
*   **Dynamic UI Scaling**: The history viewer now automatically detects terminal resizing and redraws separators and alignment perfectly.
*   **Enhanced Navigation**: Full support for **PageUp** and **PageDown** keys for rapid log traversal.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure & Maintenance
*   **Platform-Agnostic Paths**: Log path documentation now explicitly supports `%USERPROFILE%` for Windows users.
*   **Atomic Directory Creation**: Switched to a race-condition-free directory creation pattern for the central log folder.
*   **Refactored Logic**: Moved core history parsing to a module-level function for better testability and performance.

### 📚 Documentation
*   Updated `CODE_DOCUMENTATION.md` and `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY.md` to reflect the new hierarchical persistence model.
